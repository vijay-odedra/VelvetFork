                        At VelvetFork, we believe dining is more than sustenance—it's a story shared between people, a moment of connection, a memory being made.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="story-body">
                        <p>Established in 2015, VelvetFork began as a simple vision: to create a space where exceptional food meets genuine hospitality. What started as a small neighborhood restaurant has grown into a destination for those who appreciate the art of fine dining, yet never want to sacrifice comfort for elegance.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our philosophy is rooted in respect—for ingredients, for tradition, and for the craft of cooking. We work closely with local farmers and fishermen to source the finest seasonal produce, ensuring each dish tells the story of its origin while honoring the techniques passed down through generations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Every evening at VelvetFork is a carefully orchestrated experience. From the warm greeting at the door to the final farewell, we strive to create an atmosphere where guests feel both celebrated and at ease. Our team approaches service not as a transaction, but as an opportunity to create something meaningful.</p>
